# ASR-for-Wolof-Challenge

# BRIEF DESCRIPION
In a country such as Senegal, where about 50% of the population is illiterate, technologies and applications that are designed to be used by people who can read are not as effective as they could be. In this competition, your aim is to use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) techniques in the Wolof language to help illiterate people to interact with apps with just their voice, in a language they can already speak.

The goal of this competition is to build an ASR model that will help illiterate people use existing apps to find which bus they can take to reach their destination, without having to know how to read or write. check it out on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai4d-baamtu-datamation-automatic-speech-recognition-in-wolof)
